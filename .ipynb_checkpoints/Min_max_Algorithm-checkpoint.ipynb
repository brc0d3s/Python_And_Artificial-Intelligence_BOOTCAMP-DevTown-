    "# Mini-Max Algorithm in Artificial Intelligence   \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "Certainly! The Mini-Max algorithm is a decision-making algorithm commonly used in artificial intelligence for making optimal decisions in adversarial environments, such as two-player games. It helps to determine the best possible move for a player by evaluating the game state and predicting the outcome of future moves. Here's a complete explanation of the Mini-Max algorithm along with a Python code illustration:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mini-Max algorithm operates on a game tree that represents all possible moves and outcomes of a game. Each node in the tree represents a game state, and the edges represent possible moves. The goal is to find the best move for the current player, assuming the opponent also plays optimally.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm recursively explores the game tree, starting from the current game state. At each level of the tree, the algorithm alternates between maximizing and minimizing the possible outcomes. The maximizing player tries to maximize their score, while the minimizing player tries to minimize the score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step explanation of the Mini-Max algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the game state representation: You need to define how the game state is represented, including the current position, available moves, and the outcome of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Implement a function to generate all possible moves: Create a function that generates all possible moves for the current player in the given game state.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Implement a function to evaluate the game state: Create a heuristic evaluation function that assigns a score to a game state. This function should estimate how favorable the game state is for the current player.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Implement the Mini-Max algorithm: Create a recursive function that performs the Mini-Max search. This function should take the current game state, the depth of the search, and a flag indicating whether it is the maximizing or minimizing player.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Base case: If the maximum depth is reached or the game is over (i.e., a win, loss, or draw), return the score of the current game state based on the evaluation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Recursive case for the maximizing player: If it's the maximizing player's turn, iterate through all possible moves. For each move, recursively call the Mini-Max function with the new game state and decreased depth. Choose the maximum score from the recursive calls and return it.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Recursive case for the minimizing player: If it's the minimizing player's turn, iterate through all possible moves. For each move, recursively call the Mini-Max function with the new game state and decreased depth. Choose the minimum score from the recursive calls and return it.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Call the Mini-Max function: Finally, call the Mini-Max function with the initial game state and the desired depth of the search. The returned score represents the best move for the current player.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's illustrate the Mini-Max algorithm with an example of tic-tac-toe using Python code:\n",
