    "Search algorithms play a crucial role in artificial intelligence by allowing agents to explore and find optimal solutions in a problem space. These algorithms traverse a search tree or graph, systematically examining possible paths until a goal state is reached. In this note, we'll explore three common search algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and A* Search.\n",

    "## **1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Breadth-First Search is an uninformed search algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., exploring all the neighboring nodes before moving to the next level of nodes. This algorithm guarantees finding the shortest path to the goal if it exists.\n",

    "In the code above, the `breadth_first_search` function takes a `graph` (dictionary representation), `start` node, and `goal` node as input. It initializes a queue using `deque` from the `collections` module. We also create a `visited` set to keep track of visited nodes.\n",
    "\n",
